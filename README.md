# Introduction

This workshop is designed for beginners with little to no programming experience who want to learn how to work with REDCap data using R. Whether you are new to R or have some experience with spreadsheets and clinical data, this workshop will guide you through importing, cleaning, analysing, and visualising data from REDCap.

We will cover both CSV-based data import and API-based extraction, ensuring that you can access REDCap data in a reproducible way. The workshop will cover essential programming concepts and gradually introduce more advanced topics, with a focus on using the `tidyREDCap`, `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, and `tableone` packages to manage, explore, summarise and visualise your datasets. The aim of this workshop is equip participants with the skills to import, clean, analyse, and visualise REDCap data in R.
