## Introduction

This workshop is designed for beginners with little to no programming experience who want to learn how to work with REDCap data using R. Whether you are new to R or have some experience with spreadsheets and clinical data, this workshop will guide you through importing, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data from REDCap.

We will cover both CSV-based data import and API-based extraction, ensuring that you can access REDCap data in a reproducible way. The workshop will cover essential programming concepts and gradually introduce more advanced topics, with a focus on using the `tidyREDCap`, `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, and `tableone` packages to manage, explore, summarize and visualize your datasets. The aim of this workshop is equip participants with the skills to import, clean, analyze, and visualize REDCap data in R.

## Learning Objectives

Participants will gain the following skills:

- Proficiency in using R and RStudio for data analysis.
- Basic R programming skills.
- Connect to REDCap using API tokens and securely retrieve data.
- Import and clean REDCap data in R using `tidyREDCap` and `tidyverse`.
- Preprocess data, manage missing values, and reshape datasets.
- Create visualizations using `ggplot2` to explore trends in clinical data.
- Generate a Table 1 summary for clinical reports.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course you will need to ensure that your computer is set up with the required software. If you have any difficulty installing any of this software then please contact one of the trainers for help.

### Installing R and RStudio

**R** and **RStudio** are separate downloads and installations.

**R** is the underlying statistical computing environment. The base R system and a very large collection of packages that give you access to a huge range of statistical and analytical functionality are available from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org), the Comprehensive R Archive
Network.

However, using R alone is no fun. **RStudio** is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R much easier and more interactive. You need to install R before you install RStudio.

Windows
</summary>
```

-   **If you already have R and RStudio installed:**

    -   Open RStudio, and click on "Help" \> "Check for updates". If a new version is available, quit RStudio, and download the latest version for RStudio.
    -   To check which version of R you are using, start RStudio and the first thing that appears in the console indicates the version of R you are running. Alternatively, you can type `sessionInfo()`, which will also display which version of R you are running. Go on the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) and check whether a more recent version is available. If so, please download and install it. You can [check here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html#How-do-I-UNinstall-R_003f) for more information on how to remove old versions from your system if you wish to do so.

- **If you don't have R and RStudio installed:**

  - Download R from the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm).
  - Run the `.exe` file that was just downloaded
  - Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
  - Under *Installers* select **RStudio x.yy.zzz - Windows 10/8/7** where x, y, and z represent version numbers)
  - Double click the file to install it
  - Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any error messages.

- **If you don't have R and RStudio installed:**

  - Download R from the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/).
  - Select the `.pkg` file for the latest R version
  - Double click on the downloaded file to install R
  - It is also a good idea to install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) (needed by some packages)
  - Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
  - Under *Installers* select **RStudio x.yy.zzz - Mac OS X 10.6+ (64-bit)** (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)
  - Double click the file to install RStudio
  - Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any error messages.

- Follow the instructions for your distribution from  [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux), they provide information to get the most recent version of R for common distributions. For most distributions, you could use your package manager (e.g., for Debian/Ubuntu run `sudo apt-get install r-base`, and for Fedora `sudo yum install R`), but we don't recommend this approach as the versions provided by this are usually out of date. In any case, make sure you have at least R 4.3.2.
- Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
- Under *Installers* select the version that matches your distribution, and install it with your preferred method (e.g., with Debian/Ubuntu `sudo dpkg -i   rstudio-x.yy.zzz-amd64.deb` at the terminal).
- Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any error messages.

### Installing R Packages

On this course we will be making use of several packages designed for importing and processing data from REDCap, data manipulation and visualization. After installing R and RStudio, follow the instructions below to install the required packages.

- After starting RStudio, at the console type: (look for the 'Console' tab and type at the `>` prompt)

```{r}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "REDCapR", "REDCapTidieR", "httr", "jsonlite"))
```

- You can also do this by going to Tools -\> Install Packages and typing the names of the packages separated by a comma.

### Installing Quarto

To install Quarto follow this link: (https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)[https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/]. 

## Data



## Into the tidyverse

The core tidyverse includes the packages that you're likely to use in
everyday data analyses. Therefore, this workshop offers an introduction
to these core packages. As of tidyverse 1.3.0, the following packages
are included in the core tidyverse:
