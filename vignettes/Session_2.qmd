Common tasks in working with data include actions like removing rows or columns, performing calculations, or adding new columns. This sort of operations is known as data manipulation. It is the process of cleaning, organizing, and transforming raw data into a more structured and usable format for analysis.

In this workshop, we'll guide you through the process of data manipulation in R, starting with the tidyverse. The tidyverse is a collection of packages that align with a data science philosophy developed by Hadley Wickham and the RStudio team. Many users find it to be a more intuitive way to grasp R concepts. Although some tasks may be more straightforward in base-R, we'll also highlight those aspects.
